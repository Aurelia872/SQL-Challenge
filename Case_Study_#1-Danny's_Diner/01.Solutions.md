## 03. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer? ##

#### SQL Query

````sql
select
sales.customer_id as Customer,
min(sales.order_date) as Order_date,
any_value(menu.product_name) as First_item
from sales
inner join menu
on sales.product_id= menu.product_id
group by sales.customer_id;
````
<ol>
  <p> ->Inner join is used to pull data from 2 tables</p>
  <p> ->The customer_id is queried along with the calculated minimum order date from sales table and product name is pulled to display the first product on the first order date per customer</p>
  <p> ->The 'any_value' SQL command is used to avoid errors that may occur due to the group_by function </p>
  <p> ->All results are grouped by customer_id</p>
</ol>
